    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
      GPass is a tool for testing the security of a password. GPass provides the 
      password's entropy and how many guesses it would take to guarantee to find 
      the password. Entropy is defined as "A measure of the disorder or 
      randomness in a closed system," and is usually expressed in bits. 
      However, in passwords, it means how random or hard to guess the password 
      is. Therefore, the higher a password's entropy, the more difficult it is 
      for hackers to guess.
    </p>

    <p>
      To enhance entropy in a password or create a high-entropy password, there 
      are two things you can do. Firstly, increase the length of your password, 
      as longer passwords have higher entropy. For example, the passwords 
      "<code>aabbccdd</code>" and "<code>abcd</code>" have the same bits of 
      entropy per character, however, the first password has more entropy 
      because it is longer. Secondly, use more unique characters. Entropy 
      is calculated using the number of <em>unique</em> characters in a password, 
      so more unique characters means higher entropy. Usually, in a 
      password, you would want to achieve a score of 60 bits of entropy or more.
    </p>

    <p>
      We calculate entropy via Shannon Entropy, which measures bits of entropy 
      per character of a string (i.e. text). We then use the bits of entropy 
      per character to find the total entropy of the password and how many 
      guesses it would take to find the password, which is just
      2<sup><i>bits of entropy</i></sup>.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, high entropy does not mean an un-hackable password or a 
      necessarily "secure" password. For example, the passwords 
      "<code>PAsSWORD123</code>" and "<code>)g^pu>zL3/9</code>" have the same 
      amount of entropy (38.05 bits), but as you can see, the latter password 
      is clearly more secure. So, entropy should never solely be relied on to 
      tell if a password is secure or not.
